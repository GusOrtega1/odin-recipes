Recipe website for The Odin Project

This is the first official project of The Odin Project's curriculum! I will create at basic html website with four pages: one homepage and three recipe pages. By completing this website, I will get practice with basic html formatting, using <a href> to link between pages, organizing lists with <ul> and <ol>, and using <img> to incorporate images into websites.
