Recipe website for The Odin Project

This is the first official project of The Odin Project's curriculum! I will create a basic html website with four pages: one homepage and three recipe pages. By completing this website, I will get practice with basic html formatting, use anchor tag with href to link between pages, organize lists with the ul and ol tags, and use img and src to incorporate images into websites.
